====================

Provide interfaces to participants.

Exercise 1

Write a cash register implementation.
Begin by writing a test that asserts the cash register prints something to the printer.
Do not use a mocking framework like [mockito](https://code.google.com/p/mockito/).

Exercise 2
----------
Assert that the printer prints exactly a test string you provide in the test.

Exercise 3
----------
Replace your hand crafted mocks and stubs with a mocking framework.
